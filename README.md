# Estimating and Explaining Twitter Engagement

This work is for the CS 589 (Machine Learning) final project.


## Scraping Tweets from Twitter

In the case of wanting to apply the estimating / explaining techniques to new data,
follow these instructions.

- Navigate to the code/ directory

- execute 'python get_data.py \[handles\]', where the handles in brackets is

## Clustering Tweets at Different Levels of Granularity

Follow these instructions to experiment with clustering tweets in an unlabeled
way, at different levels of granularity (i.e., number of clusters). This portion
may also be useful for unsupervised feature learning.

## Explaining Popular Tweets

Follow these instructions to experiment with dimensionality reduction, explanation, 
and exploration of a set of tweets.
