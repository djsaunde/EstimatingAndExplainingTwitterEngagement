    Function to remove tweets that are retweeted from another Twitter handle.
    For now, this simply checks for the occurrence of 'RT'. I believe there is
    a more clever way to do this (check Twitter API).
    
    input:
        tweets: list of tweets (typically 200, sometimes less).
    
    output:
        list of tweets with retweets removed.
